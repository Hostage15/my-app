# MyApp - Coding Challenge

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.2.

## Get started

To install Angular on your local system, you need the following: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) & [npm package manager](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/).

### Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/Hostage15/my-app.git
```

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages and verify that it works:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```



## Run and test

cd to the project's directory

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
